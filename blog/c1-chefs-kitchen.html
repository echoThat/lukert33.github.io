          <h1>Shipping Off to Bootcamp</h1>

          <h2>First Impressions of DBC Culture</h2>
          <p>Dev Bootcamp prizes its ability to guarantee a high level of empathy in its graduates. As Shereef puts it in his <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Fireside Chat</a>, hiring managers know that DBC grads will be net gains to a company's culture even though it will take them a few months of on-boarding before they are able to carry their own weight as coders.<br>

          With emotional intelligence established as such hallmarks of DBC, it only follows that the designers of the curriculum seek reproducible methods for instilling the right attitudes and maturity in their students. It's a tricky proposition; how does one teach something that would otherwise be the product of life experience and worldview? Does it mean that the teacher is looking for tools to <i>change</i> worldviews? The short answer, I think, is yes. It's a daunting task.<br>

          To DBC's credit, they take a broad view of this question of teaching a worldview. In my prep materials so far, there has been an array of different opinions and methods presented, related to things like time management and working in an intense environment with other people. Also, these materials are presented with a mandate not to accept and internalize every prescription I read, but to follow my own interests and react to the material.<br>

          The kind of "soft skill" methods I know that I'll gravitate toward are those that acknowledge and play off the fact that people are animals, not logic machines. We need rewards. We get tired. We get mad. We need to exert ourselves physically to stay balanced. We can develop habits that we notice as little as we notice our own heartbeat. The check-in before pairing that DBC advocates as part of the pairing routine is a nice example of this. In check-in, you're encouraged to level with your pair; you can say that no, you're not feeling 100% on your game today and you can let your pair know why. It's definitely the case that anywhere you work, a line of honesty between colleagues always helps everyone work better together. Putting up an imperturbable front is a relic from an earlier era.<br>

          I have to admit that I will need to push myself to go outside of my own comfort zone with regard to trying some soft skill techniques. The Fogg method, for instance, of creating tiny habits. There's potential there. The idea is that you can add a good behavior to your life by hitching a small instance of that behavior to one of your existing habits. That habit becomes a trigger that reminds you to do the thing you want to become better about doing. BJ Fogg did pushups after he took a pee. An aspiring actor might memorize three lines of Shakespeare every day before heading out to his day job.<br>

          That all said, I had to consciously force myself to appreciate what the Fogg method was all about. I have a prejudice against boomer types who attach their last name to something and then try to sell books and lecture series about it. I may sound petty or too-cool when I say that, but it's a real bias. The Pomodoro Technique, for instance, was instantly more palatable to me because even though I don't know anything more about the tecnique's inventor, Francesco Cirillo, than I do about BJ Fogg, Cirillo didn't name his book-and-lecture-series package after himself. He named it after a tomato.<br>

          So there it is; I have a tendency to shout "snake oil!" for pretty inane reasons. *AND YET* I appreciate that DBC, in order to deliver on the promise that differentiates them from other bootcamps, needs to search far and wide for techniques that will teach empathy to a vast range of students.<br>

          As bootcamp goes on, I promise I'll correct for my bias.<br></p>
