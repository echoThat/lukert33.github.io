          <h2>The Demography of Web Development</h2>

           <h3>The Dave to Girl Ratio</h3> <p>is satirical description of the tech industry that's at least a decade old. It idea is that if you want to check on whether your company is ahead of the curve on gender diversity, you shouldn't check the Guy:Girl ratio--that's just going to be staggeringly unbalanced. You should check the Dave:Girl ratio, where you have a good shot at something "reasonable" like, say, 2 or 3 Daves per girl on the team.<p>
           <p>Is this still a relevant joke? If not, what other demographics are conspicuously underrepresented in web development? Here are the numbers, as of 2013 (via the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>:</p>
           <table>
             <tr>
               <th>Career</th>
               <th>Total Workers (thousands)</th>
               <th>% Women</th>
               <th>% Asian</th>
               <th>% Black</th>
               <th>% Hispanic/Latino</th>
             </tr>
             <tr>
               <td>All US Workers</td>
               <td>143,929</td>
               <td>47.0</td>
               <td>5.7</td>
               <td>11.2</td>
               <td>15.6</td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
               <td>App & System Software Devs</td>
               <td>1,103</td>
               <td>19.7</td>
               <td>28.8</td>
               <td>4.1</td>
               <td>5.3</td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
               <td>Web Devs</td>
               <td>192</td>
               <td>39.5</td>
               <td>8.7</td>
               <td>8.0</td>
               <td>6.5</td>
             </tr>
           </table>
           <p>For me, the most surprising finding here is how much more representative web developers are of the broader demographics of the American work force. Compared to Application Devs, and System Software Devs, every category except Hispanics and Latinos is much closer to the actual portion of the workforce it makes up. </p>
           <p>In this day and age, it seems that if we're going to make the Dave:Girl ratio joke, we have to be talking about app and system software, as opposed to web development.</p>
           <p>But here's the thing: those lines are blurring. It seems clear that the standard website these days, at long as it is more than a blog or portfolio, has to have robust applications running within it. Web development, given rising technological standards, has to be more like app development. A lot more functions will have to be built into sites.</p>
           <p>My read of this table is that the demographic skews in tech are still a huge problem. It's the CS majors that are filling those System Software roles, and CS majors still tend to fit an old-fashioned mold.</p>
           <p>The fact that web development has equalized so much with the norms of the labor force suggests that groups who were passively steered away from software development are in fact very interested in it and motivated to gain skills in it outside of an undergraduate or graduate education.</p>
           <p>I think the huge amount of self-education tools out there allow people to build their own websites, grow continually better at maintaining them, and eventually build websites for others. The real change will be when a younger generation uses these tools to understand that they have the desire to pursue a more formal education in software development.</p>
           <h3>Quick Disclaimer:</h3> <p>I do realize that the above table doesn't support every conclusion I made above. I'm extrapolating based on my observance of tech culture as a whole.</p>
           <h3>Ways Forward:</h3> <p>The reality is that encouragement and desire have been the big head start. In the early history of personal computing, PCs--and of course the video games played on them-- were viewed as a nerdy boy's toy. That a "nerdy boy" was generally perceived and portrayed as White or Asian is only further evidence of how distorted and segregating this idea was. (By the way, why do Americans with ethnic roots ranging from North Africa to Bangladesh have no category in this data? We're talking about tens of millions of citizens...)</p>
           <p>Now, however, computers are absolutely pervasive. Video games are a mainstream hobby. Nerdism is a vaunted label, so the many nerds that have always existed and were never white, asian, or male no longer sidestep the title as they probably used to.</p>
           <p>In time this will cause a sea change in the demographic of the highest levels of the tech sector. How long it takes is only a question of fueling people with diverse viewpoints to be curious about software. Most prominent, at this point, are the many avenues for introducing women to programming at a young age. <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code</a> is one of the more prominent organizations helping women become fluent in code when they are young.</p>
           <p>To my mind, the coolest methods for introducing new demographics to software are those that use it in entirely different ways than we've seen before. It's a waste of these new perspectives to only have them do what has already been done over the past decades.</p>
           <p>Let's zero in on the entertainment subset of software development for an example of what I mean. The stereotype is that boys like guns and girls like clothes; this doesn't mean that when a girl is using code to invent new enterainment media she should take on all or any of the other attending preoccupations. She shouldn't just build another first-person military shooter. Might she consider exempting herself from the graphics-measuring contest that dominated the last 20 years of digital entertainment? I sure hope so.</p>
           <p>Of course, as a white guy I can't predict what this hypothetical case or the very real upcoming generation of newly diverse tech people will actually make. But that, of course is the point. </p>
           <p>...and hopefully I can help!</p>
