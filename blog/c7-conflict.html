          <h1>Modes of Conflict, Patterns of Shame</h1>
          <h4>Nov 9, 2014</h4>

          <p>Here's an interview with myself on the subject of conflict, drawing on the compelling categories of shame presented by <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">the Southdown Institute</a>.</p>

          <br>

          <h3>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? What was the source of the conflict?</h3>

          <p>A few years ago my then-housemate (still friend) and I got into a dispute about the portioning of rent at our apartment. There <i>were</i> decisions to be made; I'd moved from being a part time resident of the place to full time, and people occupying each bedroom were changing around. We had to figure out rents. At one point, I misunderstood something he said. I'd found this apartment for the whole crew--no minor dedication of time, as any New Yorker knows. This housemate and I had also worked hard together to get out of a prior lease commitment when it turned out the place had bed bugs, and the land lord was going to let us move in without telling us. </p>

          <p>In the new place, during the discussion about rent splits, I took something my housemate said to mean that because I didn't yet live there full time, he and the others could decide to kick me out. I fumed over this for a day before confronting him on this. To his credit, he realized how angry I was and took the issue seriously. He assured me that I'd misunderstood him. Things resolved pretty quickly after that. But airing it out was as essential as disarming a bomb.</p>

          <h3>How did you handle that conflict?</h3>

          <p>I didn't stew very long on the issue, but I did let myself get quite angry about it because I felt that I was not being given credit for having found the apartment. I wish I could have kept a cooler head; it was only a discussion about money. That said, I am glad I didn't put off discussing my feelings for too long.</p>

          <h3>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h3>

          <p>It was my misapprehension that started the conflict, so ultimately it was on me. But I don't think I made it worse once the seed was planted. It was too important for me to avoid.</p>

          <h3>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</h3>

          <p>I'd like to say that I should have clarified the issue at the moment I took offense. But really, that was in the course of a long discussion. Giving the issue its own time, a day or so later, was the only way to deal with it.</p>

          <h3>What did you learn from this experience?</h3>

          <p>I learned that friends are never going to have any problem with you airing out your grievances. People are inclined to help their friends, and communication is a balm that can fix a lot of problems.</p>

          <h3>Relative to the Compass</h3>

          <p>As far as the compass of shame goes, I tend toward Avoidance, the southern point. I am apt to exempt myself from a conflict by convincing myself that I'm above it. It's probably an arrogant pattern of behavior, though I will say it allows me to keep a level head even if something does blow up. I just have to be better about addressing conflicts that do need addressing, and not letting them go unresolved.</p>
