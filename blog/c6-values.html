          <h1>Some Key Values</h1>
          <h4>Nov 2, 2014</h4>
          <p>Going through DBC's suggested values to consider, I can say that the below are especially important to me. I've included the scale rating recommended by DBC, which maps to the importance of living up to each value. 1 implies that I consider myself flexible on that value, 5 that I would feel awful having compromised it.</p>

          <p>It's obvious that if I am going to expound on one of these, I should pick a 5. That said, I'd like to point out that the lower scores only denote that these are lower on the scale of what I know I am willing to make day-to-day compromises on. Everything on this table is of major import to me.</p>

          <p>But I'll delve a bit further into <b>Ambition</b>. So many of the above values are tied up with each other, but for me Amibition conflates most with <b>Meaningful work</b> and <b>Independence</b>.</p>

          <p>One of my good friends recently shared a very specific realization with me. It gets at what I talk about when I talk ambition. Over the past few years, he came to see that he overwhelmingly dates women who work in healthcare in some way. His words: "It's because they want to fix the world but they understand they have to contribute to a giant system to do that."</p>

          <p>I value the brand of ambition that my friend prefers in the people he dates. An individual's life work is a substantial thing. I think people should always be sure that what they are pouring their efforts into, day in and day out, contributes to making life better for others. Healthcare is a very direct way to care for others; the benefit you provide patients with is inarguable. It's the second part of the statement, about contributing to a giant system, that is all the more interesting.</p>

          <p>Ambition generally associated with being in a position of power. We should consider that it's nearly as ambitious to spend your efforts contributing to a cause that you think can make big changes, as it is to be one of the people running that cause.</p>

          <p>Independence still comes into this in a major way. There are so many opportunities for people to choose careers that produce money and not much else. Truly ambitious people resist that obvious (and wonderful) benefits of personal wealth, and instead try to contribute to the betterment of society while keeping themselves secure enough.</p>

          <p>Ambition is spending a lifetime working at bringing things into being that didn't exist before, or making what you found a little bit more ideal.</p>

          <h3>Ambition and Stereotype Threat</h3>

          <p>Oh damn: Am I an upper middle class white dude blogging about how ambition is such a social good? The idea smells off-puttingly Ayn Randian when I think about it that way. All I can offer in my defense is that the kind of ambition I support begins with an independent thought: "What do I want to contribute to?" There are an infinite amount of asnwers to this question. The most popular is the most boring and least ambitious, and it has to do with the size of one's checking account.</p>

          <h3>Advice</h3>

          <p>The last topic someone asked me to help on was about a job change. He was debating between two offers, an offer at a new company that he really wanted to work at and a counteroffer from his current job to pay him more to keep it. The current job had more money tied to it. Partially because this guy already made far more money than me--and therefore the lower pay already seemed stellar--I told him to evaluate whether the difference in pay between staying and going was higher than the difference between liking what he did every day. We talked it over, and he said he'd weigh it. He ended up staying, which was a surprise to me, but he did end up leaving for an even better combination of great job and great pay about six months later.</p>
