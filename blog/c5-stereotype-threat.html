          <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
          <h4>October 26, 2014</h4>
          <p>In Claude M. Steele's <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/thin-ice-stereotype-threat-and-black-college-students/304663/3/">1999 article in The Atlantic</a>, this line leapt out to me as exceptionally important: "A person has to care about a domain in order to be disturbed by the prospect of being stereotyped in it."</p>

          <p><b>Stereotype threat</b> is Steele's term for the phenomenon of diminished performance because of anxiety about being judged based on stereotypes related to the performance. More concretely: black american college students being tested on literature after having been subtly reminded of their race do, Steele observed, perform worse than if they were not reminded of their race. This is because of a stereotype about black americans underacheiving in fields like literary academia.</p>

          <p>Steele's line about caring about a domain stood out to me because it gets at the truly horrible effect of stereotype threat. The most obvious issue is that it can hinder performance. It creates anxiety in people related to factors that shouldn't bear on their performance. On an individual basis, this can be overcome. Enough experience with a given pursuit can give you the capacity you need to overcome almost any kind of anxiety. It's not fair, mind you. It's terrible that some people have to put in more effort than others simply because of large, blind social realities. </p>

          <p>But the truly endemic problem that stereotype threat creates is that entire groups of people avoid entire fields of work because of the threshold of anxiety entailed by steretypes about the category of person they happen to be. In the tech world, this is starkly manifest. There are is a freakishly low ratio of women, black people, and hispanic people working in tech jobs in the US than there are in the general working population. Stereotype threat is one of the very real causes of this. </p>

          <p>One of the most insightful things I remember hearing in college came from a TA who happened to be gay. She pointed out that in America, the only people who are invisible in public are white men. For everyone else, race or gender is something that is noticed.</p>

          <p>That insight stuck with me. I'm a white guy in America, so in most contexts of my external traits are relatively invisible. What I'm saying or doing is generally the first thing someone notices about me, and that's a huge blessing. To paraphrase Martin Luther King, I have the good fortune of being judged by the content of my character rather than the color of my skin.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon of stereotype threat that Steele identified is one of the most pressing problems of discrimination that faces our society today. A generation ago, we dispensed with many of the laws the prevent real equality in the US. What we need to do today is deal with the remaining ghosts of racist attitudes. These continue to weigh on the decisions people make about their lives; they dictate the domains they care about.</p>

          <p>I hope that in every environment I work in, I can work to ensure that everyone is judged by what they bring to the present task. What's tragic is that there is enough racism left in this country to reduce the range of person who I am priveleged to find myself working beside.</p>
