          <h1>Feedback in DBC</h1>
          <h4>October 19, 2014</h4>
          <h2>Pairing and Sharing</h2>

 <p>I admit to being skeptical about the practice of paired programming. In the abstract, it makes sense. Problems in a system could be handled more quickly with two trained minds fully concentrating on it. Problems would be astronomically less likely to stall both people at the same time. It's a lot like two pilots operating a badass giant robot via a neural bridge, as in <i>Pacific Rim</i>:</p>

  <p>...but I figured it was only applicable to really tough problem, whereas one solid programmer should (I thought) be able to work through a standard-issue problem solo.</p>

  <p>I was wrong. The ability to not get stuck is <i>one</i> benefit to pairing. It's not the biggest. The biggest benefit is the transfer of skills between people.</p>

  <p>So far my best pairs have been those where one person has an authoritative grasp on the problem, relative to the other. I say this having been on both sides of that dynamic. If you are the person who knows less--for instance, as I knew <i>way</i> less about CSS layout conventions--you get to go to school in an especially hands-on way. If you are the person who is taking the lead, you have the chance to solidify your skills by articulating them. In the process you figure out other, better ways of finishing a task.</p>

  <p>That's where the key benefit of pairing has been for me so far. Pairing is a chance for me to crystalize my ideas about how to get things done.</p>

  <p>I had expected it to be better overall to simply run through all of the DBC exercises myself--assuming that if I solved all the problems on my own, I'd be better off--but the reality is that talking things over and justifying my decisions to someone else is a stickier, and I suspect more efficient, way to learn.</p>

  <h3>Feedback; how did you feel when you read it?</h3>
<p>So far I've been unsurprised by my feedback. My feedback has tracked with how I perceived my pairing sessions having gone. Fortunately, every session has felt positive and successful; even the most arduous. So overall my feedback has been helpful in, at best, an ambient sense.</p>

<p>Please don't take ambient as a pejorative. I do recognize the benefit to the feedback being such a routine part of the DBC program. It's good that I have a pattern of data that says I'm, apparently, doing pretty well. I suspect that the existence of such a pattern will mean that, should I do poorly for a session or two, I'll be able to recognize that without it being a crisis situation.</p>

<h3>Based on the feedback you've received, how are you going to improve?</h3>
<p>So far what I've taken away from pairing sessions is that it's best to agree to driver-navigator roles early. We can always switch, and it's easy to waffle on the subject, but the best course so far has been to agree on roles quickly and see where things go from there.</p>

<h3>How was it to write feedback?</h3>
<p>Writing feedback is easy for me; it helps that my pairs so far have always felt productive.</p>
<h3>What was most difficult about writing feedback for your pair?</h3>
<p>I suspect I'll have to really push myself to give someone truly bad feedback, even were it to be warranted. We've all given up a lot of time, money, and opportunity to be here, so I see myself being loathe to actively obstruct someone else's path through DBC. <b>Yet:</b> I think I'll be able to provide acute criticism if I have to, largely because I know that if my bad feedback is one outlier in the bulk of feedback we all give, I'll serve only as a critic, not a naysayer.</p>
