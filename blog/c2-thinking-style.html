          <h2>Applying Categories to My Mind</h2>

          <h3>Gregorc Thinking Style</h3>
          <p>As you can see from the above graph, the Gregorc thinking style test categorizes me more in terms of what I'm not than what I am. My mind style is, to roughly equal extents, Concrete-Random, Abstract-Random, and Abstract-Sequential. I do not seem to have the attributes of a Concrete-Sequential thinker, at least per one questionairre.</p>
          <p>What does it mean that I tend away from Concrete-Sequential thinking? I went to Dr. Gregorc's <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">page about mind styles</a> to learn more. I must say, I disagree with the notion that I am averse to or lack the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>an affinity for getting facts</li>
            <li>predictable situations</li>
            <li>applying ideas in pragmatic ways</li>
          </ul>
          <p>While it's true that I'd rather not have every day be predictable, I generally am in favor of predictability when it comes to doing work. I also like to think that I prefer to operate on the basis of facts, and that I'd rather apply ideas than simply come up with them, write them down, and put them in a drawer. To not test an idea out in some practical way is to not fully generate the idea. As Milton wrote in his <i>Areopagitica</i>, "Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse in a free and open encounter?" An idea requires a free and open encounter to become anything resembling a truth.</p>
          <p>That said, the two entries on Abstract-Random and Concrete-Random do resonate with my experience. I would agree, I suppose, that I fit Gregorc's definition of a Random-Sequential thinker. One should be aware of one's flaws, so I think the cautionary tales are the lessons to take from this. To that end, here are tendencies that sound familiar, and that I should take note of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a dislike of formal reports</li>
            <li>the struggle to keep detailed records</li>
            <li>a preference to have options, as opposed to not</li>
            <li>a distase for dictatorial/authoritarian personalities</li>
            <li>aversion to the need to justify my feelings</li>
            <li>aversion to work in a restrictive environment</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some of those distastes feel worthy of note. I should account for my dislike of formal reports, and find a solution for generating such reports. I should realize that I need to strive to keep detailed records when the situation calls for it. Do I need to develop a taste for authoritarian personalities and restrictive environments? I don't see the point.</p>
          <h3>Fixed versus Growth Mindset</h3>
          <p>Dr. Carol Dweck, along with Dr. Gregorc, is has done prominent research on learning styles. Unlike Gregorc, Dweck outlines a more absolute  difference between two ways of being. Dweck describes Fixed Mindsets and Growth Mindsets, and the latter is obviously preferable to the former.</p>
          <p>Essentially, a Growth-minded person acknowledges their own limitations and, having done so, seeks to expands them. A Fixed-minded person perceives their capacity as set and unchangeable. It seems clear that our society encourages Growth-mindsets explicitly, but implicitly it may be that our culture of test-based and career-based identity thumps people into Fixed-mindsets I would suggest that at least two of the major cultural forces in world history--Christian Calvinism and Caste-based Hinduism--certainly lay rich foundations for a society of fixed-mindsets.</p>
          <p>Luckily, our technologically-oriented world favors the growth-minded. I agree with Carol Dweck that this is plainly the better way to be.</p>
          <h3>Practical Ways Forward</h3>
          <p>Having reflected on the work Gregorc and Dweck, I think that a system of more organization and discipline will allow me to work better in DBC and onward. Actually, I think these blog posts are the perfect blend of routine, formal reporting, and practical wrestling with ideas that I need. In writing fiction, I constantly struggle to tend to my current projects daily, but I know how useful that is. Blogging provides an opportunity for that level of reflection and processing in my coding life.</p>
