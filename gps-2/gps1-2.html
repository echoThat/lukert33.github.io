        <h4>What is Pair Programming?</h4>
        <p>Simultaneous and collaborative programming. One essential part is that the content being worked on is viewable by both pairs, with changes happening in real time. It can be done in person of remotely.</p>
        <h4>Why is Pair Programming Important to DBC?</h4>
        <p>We'll end up doing it in real life. On top of that, it disseminates skills.</p>
        <h4>Compare Driver and Navigator</h4>
        <p>The driver's hands are on the keyboard. The navigator is thinking big picture. The latter googling and catching typos and mistakes.</p>
        <h4>Reflect on Pairing</h4>
        <p>So far I'm very impressed with pairing's ability to make things stick in you head. Part of it is the need to articulate what you're doing, which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debuggers</a> have known the use of forever. The other part is being exposed to someone with a different skillset or way of doing things, and tackling the same exact problem. Pairing makes you justify your habits; you pick up and reinforce good ones, and revise bad ones.</p>
