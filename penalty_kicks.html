  <h1>The story so far...</h1>
  <p>This World Cup has been huge for your home nation of New North Hebrides. The globe now knows the name of your small island home. Your team has fought its way to the finals, and churned through more than 120 minutes of burtal competition against your rivals, hailing from a wealthy European country of over 100 million people.</p>
  <p>You are the fifth man for your team to attempt a kick. Each team has made four, and the fifth man from your rival's team has just missed his attempt. If you make this shot, you'll be the most famous New North Hebridean in the world. If not, well let's not dwell on that...</p>
